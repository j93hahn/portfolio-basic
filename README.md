Hi, my name is Joshua Ahn and I am a rising second year at the University of Chicago, intending on majoring in computer science with a B.S.

I've created a personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript. This repository contains all the code I used to create my website. However, I am currently working on a new version of my website, which I will be building with Django- this website will be up and running by the end of September. 

The link to my website is: 

If you would like to contact me, all my information is listed on the website.

Hope you enjoy! :)
